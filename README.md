# ThreeAddrCompiler
This project is a compiler designed to process arithmetic expressions with operators (+, -, *, /), parentheses, and integers. It performs lexical analysis using Flex, syntax analysis with Bison, and generates intermediate three-address code for error-free compilation of expressions.
